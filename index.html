                    <h1>Inauguration</h1>
                    <p>Work was interrupted due to the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. The unfinished buildings were
                       requisitioned to store food for the military and straw for the horses. The defeat of Sedan, 
                       in 1870, provoked the fall of the Empire, the military occupation of the capital and led to 
                       the episode of the Paris Commune of 1871. The advent of the provisional government of Thiers, 
                       then of the Third Republic, did not change the situation. If, at first, the economic difficulties 
                       of the France do not allow to continue the excessive expenses incurred for the future opera, it is 
                       then and above all for the symbol it represents and the embarrassment it creates among the new 
                       elites that one hesitates to take the decision to complete the commission of a discredited regime.
                       We do not know what to do, except to dismiss Garnier and continue to use the room of the rue Le Peletier.</p>

                       <p>On October 28, 1873, the old opera house on Rue Le Peletier — which had served as a temporary 
                        opera house in Paris since 1821 — was destroyed in a fire. The architect was recalled to complete 
                        the construction of the new Opera House; But he struggles to bring together his scattered collaborators,
                        companies and all the craftsmen who have just gone through a period of uncertainty.
                        Disappointments will arise: the increase in the cost of raw materials, the disappearance of artists 
                        leaving unfinished models, unrespected plans with irreparable decorative consequences.
                        </p> 
                        <p> The inauguration took place on Tuesday, January 5, 1875 in the presence of the President of the Republic 
                            Mac Mahon, the Lord Mayor of London, the Mayor of Amsterdam, the Royal Family of Spain and nearly 
                            two thousand guests from all over Europe and elsewhere. The program includes:

                        <p>Charles Garnier would have been invited (sources differ on this point). He must pay for his 
                           place in a second box. This incident, particularly regrettable and moreover mocked by the press 
                           of the time — "an administration making the architect pay the right to attend the inauguration 
                           of one's own monument! —, expresses a rejection of the new rulers towards those who, directly or 
                           indirectly, served the deposed emperor, who died in 1873, and the usual ingratitude of the 
                           powerful towards artists.</p>
                           <p>On February 7, it is the masked and transvestite ball of the Opera, annual event of the Carnival 
                            of Paris, it brings together eight thousand participants37. The last edition of this ball, created 
                            in 1715, will take place there in 1903.</p>
                            <p>In October 1896, on the occasion of their visit to France, the Russian Tsar Nicholas II and his
                               wife Alexandra went to the opera, where they attended a performance with the President of the 
                               Republic Felix Faure. When they left the Place de l'Opéra, around fifteen midnight, a large 
                               crowd cheered the imperial couple38.</p>

                    <H1>Performance</H1>
                    <p>The Opera Garniera, or Palais Garniera, is a national theatre 
                       that aims to be an academy of music, choreography and lyric 
                       poetry; it is a major element of the heritage of the 9th arrondissement 
                       of Paris and the capital. It is located on Place de l'Opéra, at the northern 
                       end of Avenue de l'Opéra and at the crossroads of many track sb.
                       It is accessible by metro (Opera station), RER (line A, Auber station) and bus. 
                       <br>
                       The building stands out as a monument particularly representative of the eclectic
                       architecture and historicist style of the second half of the nineteenth century.
                       On a design by the architect Charles Garnier selected following a competition, 
                       its construction, decided by Napoleon III as part of the transformations of Paris 
                       led by the prefect Haussmann and interrupted by the war of 1870, was resumed at 
                       the beginning of the Third Republic, after the destruction by fire of the opera 
                       Le Peletier in 1873. The building was inaugurated on 5 January 1875 by President 
                       Mac Mahon under the Third Republic. 
                       <br>
                       This opera was called "Paris Opera" until 1989, 
                       when the opening of the Opéra Bastille, also the Paris Opera, influenced its name. 
                       It is now referred to by the name of its architect alone: "Opera Garnier" or "Palais Garnier".
                       The two operas are now grouped together within the public industrial and commercial 
                       establishment "Opéra national de Paris", a French public institution whose mission is 
                       to implement the performance of lyrical or ballet performances, of high artistic quality. 
                       The Opera Garnier has been classified as a historical monument since 16 October 1923.
